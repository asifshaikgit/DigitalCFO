					<h1>How does IDOS empower our business with data analytics?</h1>
					<div class="small-bar"></div>
					<p>IDOS is more than just an accounting software and its power lies in its ability to empower your business to engage with the eco-system in which it operates through data analytics and thereby enables your business to become more competitive, reduce operating costs, increase revenue and profits.</p>
					<div class="para-read-more">
						<p class="content-para ellipsed"><strong>Customer analytics</strong>IDOS has in-built customer and sales analysis capability through which the business managers would be able to determine (in real-time), which branch or project is generating highest sales, for what items and which of the customers of that branch are placing highest number of orders. Further the business can drill down and understand at what price the goods or services are being sold to those customers and what discount percentage is currently being provided to them. The information will enable business managers to create more effective marketing and sales strategies targeting specific geographies and customer segments and help the business to drive more sales.</p>

							<p><strong>Vendor analytics</strong>IDOS provides real-time price analytics capability to business managers to understand the cost of various procurements, by analysing the purchase patterns, price charged by different vendors for the same item, cost of that item at different branches and provides valuable insights to determine, during which period the cost of such procurement is low and also which vendor is able to supply that item at the most optimal price. This capability in IDOS enables the business to plan their routine purchases more efficiently and also negotiate bulk discounts and better payment terms with vendors on whom the business is placing large orders and thereby enhance their ability to effectively manage their working capital.</p>
							<div class="para-read-more">
								<p class="content-para ellipsed"><strong>Engagement with business eco-system</strong>IDOS enables the business to effectively engage with the business eco-system in which it operates. It empowers the business to interact with its own employees and enhance their experience in transacting with the company through payroll and claims management modules. It provides the capability to customers and also vendors who do business with the company to communicate and engage with the company through uniquely architected “Engagement screens”, through which customers can place orders on the company and these orders are automatically updated in the company’s sales order management module. Similarly, vendors can evaluate the buying patterns of the company and offer strategic discounts on specific items and at specific times of the year, thereby making the purchase process more cost effective for the company. IDOS can be customised to identify and deploy similar capabilities for the company so as to ensure that it is better engaged with all its stakeholders.</p>
