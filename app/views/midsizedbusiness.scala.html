						<p class="content-para ellipsed"><strong>Reduced turnaround time for accounting &amp; financial processes</strong>Organizations which have two or more branches find it challenging to ensure consistency of transaction processing and reporting across all the branches. The staff at the branches come with different educational or academic background and they may not be trained on these processes nor on the software, thus making it necessary to get them trained before they can handle the responsibilities independently.<br/>If there is attrition, then the process of hiring, training and getting new staff ready to handle the responsibilities will have a gestation period during which there could be process delays impacting the accounting activity. Due to its ease of use, IDOS does not require the users to be knowledgeable either in accounting or in technology and therefore any member of staff can process transactions and eliminate the hurdles associated with attrition. This enhances the overall process efficiency and consequently reduces the turnaround time with respect to accounting and financial processes of the business.</p>

						<p class="content-para ellipsed"><strong>Internal financial controls</strong>Medium sized businesses which have multiple branches and employees across different branches and departments, need to implement internal financial controls to ensure that the organization functions in accordance to certain protocols and also in compliance to regulatory requirements. These controls would provide the assurance that the processes are being carried out as per defined protocols that the management has established and would also help in reduction of discrepancies.  IDOS is one of the only software which has developed and inbuilt internal controls for all accounting transactions in a way that the transaction is subjected to real-time internal audit even before it is posted to ledgers, thereby ensuring the highest levels of data accuracy and data reliability.</p>
