He started his career at PwC where he worked in their assurance division &amp; thereafter worked at outsourced arm of an International bank, in Bangalore where he was involved in providing account services to retail customers of the bank in USA.</p>

          <p style="display:none" class="read-more">He then worked in a few small accounting firms for two years before starting his own accounting and bookkeeping services business and diversified the services business to provide legal outsourcing and also software development with focus on developing modules in accounting and financial processes to customers in USA. He has over twenty years of rich &amp; diverse experience in multiple domains encompassing bookkeeping, accounting, financial management, reporting, auditing, outsourcing, software project management and software product development.<br><br>Based on his experience in professional services, Srikanth realised that the key challenge faced by businesses, is the non-availability of accurate, reliable and compliant financial data in real-time, which was leading to multiple upstream inefficiencies, delayed reporting and delays in decision making. To solve this problem, Srikanth wanted to find a way to eliminate errors and discrepancies in bookkeeping, accounting &amp; transaction processing and automate the processes in a way that it generates output which is accurate, reliable, compliant and most importantly real-time, which would empower business managers and owners deliver significantly better outcomes for their businesses. This led to him creating IDOS based on over three years of R&amp;D and multiple trial &amp; errors and he developed the functional architecture and the interface whereby every type of transaction is processed by enabling the user to answer simple questions which do not need knowledge of accounting, tax or internal controls and the software completes accounting, ledger posting in compliance to internal controls and tax. He further went on to develop more transformational capabilities which were possible to be built on core of IDOS including eco-system engagement and liquidity optimisation which enable transformational changes, in terms of how accounting and financial management is handled by businesses of all sizes and is also transforming multiple elements of commerce, accounting and financial operations including digital lending, bill discounting, borrower management by banks, vendor and procurement management, dealer &amp; distributor management, customer engagement, hub &amp; spoke accounting, real-time consolidation of accounts, remote and real-time audit, automated internal audit and so on.<br><br>Srikanth is the product owner at IDOS and his focus is on product development, strategic alliances and business expansion. He is a frequent speaker at prestigious forums on entrepreneurship, fintech and digital transformation in accounting &amp; financial management and is a Member of National Committee on IT &amp; ITES at CII.<br><br>‍</p>
